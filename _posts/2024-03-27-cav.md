Our paper <<Avoiding the Shoals - A New Approach to Liveness Checking>> is accepted at [CAV 2024](https://i-cav.org/2024/).

This paper introduces a new model checking approach, namely, rlive, for liveness properties of finite-state symbolic transition systems. 
Our experimental results show that our implementation of rlive outperforms state-of-the-art implementations of FAIR, KLIVE and other SAT-based liveness checking algorithms 
on a wide range of benchmarks from the literature.
