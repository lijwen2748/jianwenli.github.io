Our paper <<Model-Guided Synthesis for LTL over Finite
Traces>> is accepted at [VMCAI 2024](https://popl24.sigplan.org/home/VMCAI-2024).

This paper introduces a novel approach to acclerate LTLf synthesis via LTLf satisfiability checking. The results show that the approach outperforms all other methodologies off the shelve.
